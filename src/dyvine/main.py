"""Main FastAPI application for Dyvine - Douyin Content Management API.

This module serves as the entry point for the Dyvine application, a high-performance
FastAPI-based REST API for interacting with Douyin (TikTok) content. It provides
comprehensive functionality for downloading, managing, and analyzing Douyin content
including videos, images, live streams, and user data.

Application Architecture:
    The application follows a layered architecture pattern:
    - Presentation Layer: FastAPI routers and endpoints
    - Business Logic Layer: Service classes with domain logic
    - Data Access Layer: External API integration (Douyin, R2 storage)
    - Cross-cutting Concerns: Logging, error handling, dependency injection

Key Features:
    - RESTful API endpoints for Douyin content management
    - Asynchronous request processing with connection pooling
    - Comprehensive error handling with structured responses
    - Request correlation tracking and structured logging
    - Cloudflare R2 integration for content storage
    - Health monitoring and metrics collection
    - CORS support for web browser integration
    - Production-ready deployment configuration

Middleware Stack:
    1. CORS middleware for cross-origin request handling
    2. Request correlation middleware for tracking
    3. Error handling middleware for unified responses
    4. Custom logging middleware for structured logs

Service Dependencies:
    - DouyinHandler: Core integration with Douyin platform
    - UserService: User profile and content operations
    - StorageService: Cloudflare R2 storage integration
    - LoggingService: Structured logging with correlation IDs

Environment Configuration:
    The application uses environment-based configuration:
    - API_DEBUG: Enable debug mode and verbose logging
    - DOUYIN_COOKIE: Authentication cookie for Douyin API
    - R2_* variables: Cloudflare R2 storage configuration
    - SECURITY_* variables: API keys and security settings

Example Usage:
    Start the development server:
        uvicorn src.dyvine.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    Production deployment:
        gunicorn src.dyvine.main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker

    Health check:
        curl http://localhost:8000/health

        Open http://localhost:8000/docs for Swagger UI
        Open http://localhost:8000/redoc for ReDoc documentation

    """FastAPI application lifespan context manager.

    Manages the complete lifecycle of the Dyvine application including:
    - Startup initialization (logging, services, dependencies)
    - Runtime state management
    - Graceful shutdown procedures
    - Resource cleanup and finalization

    This context manager ensures proper initialization order and handles
    both successful startup/shutdown and error scenarios during application
    lifecycle events.

    Startup Sequence:
        1. Initialize structured logging system
        2. Create and configure logger instance
        3. Record application start time for uptime tracking
        4. Initialize service container with all dependencies
        5. Log successful startup with environment information

    Shutdown Sequence:
        1. Log shutdown initiation with uptime statistics
        2. Allow service container cleanup (if implemented)
        3. Flush any pending logs or metrics
        4. Release system resources

    Args:
        app: FastAPI application instance to manage.

    Yields:
        None: Control is yielded to the running application.

    Example:
        This function is automatically called by FastAPI when configured
        as the lifespan handler:

        app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

    Note:
        Any unhandled exceptions during startup will prevent the application
        from starting. During shutdown, exceptions are logged but don't
        prevent the shutdown process.

    This middleware provides comprehensive request tracking and logging for all
    HTTP requests processed by the application. It generates unique correlation
    IDs for request tracing, measures request duration, and logs request/response
    metadata for monitoring and debugging purposes.

    Features:
        - Generates unique correlation ID for each request
        - Logs request start with method, path, and client information
        - Measures and logs request processing duration
        - Adds correlation ID to response headers for client tracking
        - Handles both successful and failed request scenarios

    Request Flow:
        1. Generate unique UUID4 correlation ID
        2. Attach correlation ID to request state and logger context
        3. Log request initiation with metadata
        4. Process request through application stack
        5. Measure total processing time
        6. Log request completion with performance metrics
